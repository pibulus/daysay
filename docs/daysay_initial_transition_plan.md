# DaySay Initial Transition Plan

## Project Overview
DaySay is a voice-based journaling app that allows users to speak about their day and save audio transcriptions as daily entries. Each entry is visualized as a card, creating a simple timeline of journal entries. The app maintains the ghost component from TalkType/Ziplist as a central UI element and feedback mechanism during audio recording.
